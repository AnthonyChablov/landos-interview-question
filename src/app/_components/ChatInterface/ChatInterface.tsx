Acidity gives freshness and structure, tannins provide texture (especially in reds), alcohol should complement the other elements, and sweetness must be subtle and well-integrated. When these components align, the wine feels smooth, complex, and enjoyable. Balance ensures that no one element dominates, creating a wine that feels seamless on the palate."

While personal preference is the ultimate judge of whether a wine is good, these elements—balance, complexity, finish, and typicity—serve as the foundation for evaluating its overall quality. Ultimately, a good wine is one that is pleasurable and resonates with your individual tastes."
